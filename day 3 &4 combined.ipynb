Research Objective: This study aimed to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect early signs of pneumonia from chest X-rays. Method: The study used NIH's chest X-ray dataset with over 100,000 images and trained a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers, using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. Results: The CNN model achieved an accuracy of 92.3% and a precision of 91.5%. Key Takeaway: The study demonstrates that deep learning models like CNN can assist in early and accurate medical diagnosis, potentially reducing the burden on radiologists."
